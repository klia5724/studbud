# Studbud
## Web App
Studbud is a web application aimed to help language students manage their learning. Below is a list of things that I have taken into account whilst iterating from my mockups as well as a reference list of resources I've looked into.

## Header-Buttons
Differing from my mockups, the buttons to add new tasks and columns were merged under a single "edit" button. This would let the user edit their columns and tasks in a single popup however, I realised that this added too many unecessary steps and lead to more user effort to do a simple thing as add a new task. This led to the separation of the button into two to make it simpler.

Additionally, in my original mockup, Studbud had the choice of adding different boards for different subjects the student had, however after reflecting, it seemed redundant in comparison to the overview that the kanban board already provided. 

## Main-Kanban Board
The kanban board is effective for task management being able to act as a tasklist by creating tasks and further defining details (title, description, due date, priority, time estimated for completion) that a tasklist would offer whilst dynamically visualising the completion status of each task.

Hence I did not create a separate tasklist and instead integrated it into the kanban board where users can use a column to act as an "undone" tasklist. This prevents redundancy as users do not need to view the same tasks again.

Also, the dark mode of the web app highlights other colours and allows for greater contrast in consideration of accessibility.

## Sidebar
The sidebar allows for easier access of secondary features (music player, timers, dictionary) and saving user effort by not needing to click to another page and leave the kanban board.
